# Donation Campaign



## Features
Responsive:
This project is responsive and works on Desktop, Laptop, Tab, and Mobile without any problem. This code does not have any bottom bar that will harm user experience. We used Reichart for this.
- Statistics:
This project shows how many campaigns The user supported and what percentage. Readers can see which campaign he donated to. One can not donate to the same campaign twice. We used toste to inform about whether the donation was successful or not
- Details:
My Project shows detailed information about the campaigns. So people can support which one they want. They can have full information about what happened and How they are working. We used a card as a button so when one presses on the campaign card it will take you to the detail page.
